699232824990285824|Mon Feb 15 14:04:31 +0000 2016|Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!

694984821093830656|Wed Feb 03 20:44:28 +0000 2016|Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."
694979360441384960|Wed Feb 03 20:22:46 +0000 2016|Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
694964856609439745|Wed Feb 03 19:25:08 +0000 2016|The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
694963798273323008|Wed Feb 03 19:20:55 +0000 2016|This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CaUB4yvUEAEPbf3.jpg
694960957928431617|Wed Feb 03 19:09:38 +0000 2016|I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
694890328273346560|Wed Feb 03 14:28:59 +0000 2016|Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
694888332099239936|Wed Feb 03 14:21:03 +0000 2016|And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
694885775431835648|Wed Feb 03 14:10:53 +0000 2016|The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
694884902618165248|Wed Feb 03 14:07:25 +0000 2016|Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
694882228665507840|Wed Feb 03 13:56:48 +0000 2016|During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
694879900256354304|Wed Feb 03 13:47:33 +0000 2016|Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

667519608505659392|Fri Nov 20 01:47:31 +0000 2015|Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete &amp; total dud!

258596208350748672|Wed Oct 17 15:51:55 +0000 2012|Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.
258593090107998208|Wed Oct 17 15:39:31 +0000 2012|Remember, new "environment friendly" lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
258591443256475648|Wed Oct 17 15:32:59 +0000 2012|Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities.

258584864163500033|Wed Oct 17 15:06:50 +0000 2012|My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
258575681275965440|Wed Oct 17 14:30:21 +0000 2012|Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
258572492044660737|Wed Oct 17 14:17:40 +0000 2012|Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
258572175634743296|Wed Oct 17 14:16:25 +0000 2012|Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
258566974085423104|Wed Oct 17 13:55:45 +0000 2012|Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
258566750071824384|Wed Oct 17 13:54:51 +0000 2012|I still love Derek, he is a winner!
258566665388843009|Wed Oct 17 13:54:31 +0000 2012|Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot.
258565793749544961|Wed Oct 17 13:51:03 +0000 2012|At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it? He lost me a long time ago.
258564445238853632|Wed Oct 17 13:45:42 +0000 2012|Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated.
258544552179269633|Wed Oct 17 12:26:39 +0000 2012|Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
258542382667149312|Wed Oct 17 12:18:02 +0000 2012|George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
258538212308447232|Wed Oct 17 12:01:27 +0000 2012|Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. 
258399470440546306|Wed Oct 17 02:50:09 +0000 2012|Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
258394846191054849|Wed Oct 17 02:31:46 +0000 2012|You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
258392659385802752|Wed Oct 17 02:23:05 +0000 2012|Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
258391266109292544|Wed Oct 17 02:17:33 +0000 2012|.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
258389970090340353|Wed Oct 17 02:12:24 +0000 2012|Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
258389924456312832|Wed Oct 17 02:12:13 +0000 2012|Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
258382694520586240|Wed Oct 17 01:43:29 +0000 2012|Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
258381269258338306|Wed Oct 17 01:37:49 +0000 2012|Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.
258378469950513152|Wed Oct 17 01:26:42 +0000 2012|Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
258378264677060609|Wed Oct 17 01:25:53 +0000 2012|.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
258375641148321793|Wed Oct 17 01:15:27 +0000 2012|So far @MittRomney is winning big.
258375096064950273|Wed Oct 17 01:13:17 +0000 2012|Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
258374127688232960|Wed Oct 17 01:09:27 +0000 2012|Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
258373635822215168|Wed Oct 17 01:07:29 +0000 2012|Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
258373566196768771|Wed Oct 17 01:07:13 +0000 2012|Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
